# Sorting techniques

 __In place sorting__: Sorting algorithm that doesn't require extra space (new arrays) to sort the input (Bubble sort is an example).
 
 __Not-in-place sorting__: Sorting algorithm that requires extra space to perform the sorting (Merge sort is an example).
 
 __Stable sorting__: Sorting algorithm that keeps the similar input elements order.
 
 __Unstable sorting__: Sorting algorithm that changes the sequence of similar content in which they appear. (Quick sort).
 
 __Adaptative sorting__: Sorting algorithm that takes advantage of already 'sorted' elements in the list that is to be sorted.
 
 __Non adaptative sorting__: Sorting algorithm that does not take into account the elements which are already sorted.
