Everybody agree about the fact that _Java_ is verbose but yet a great language that is widly used over the industry. 
The version 8 introduced a lot of stuff that helps developers reduce de verbosity of their code.

## Project Lombok

When i start a Java project, the first dependency i take is [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org). It helps me in so many ways when i am writing my code that it became frustrating to me when i can't find it on the classpath of the project i am working on. 

### @Log (@CommonLog/@Slf4j/@Log4j/...)

This simple annotation replaces the long line that i keep forgetting : 

```java 
private static final org.apache.commons.logging.Log log =
org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory.getLog(LogExample.class);
```

### Accessors, Equals and HashCode (@Getter/@Setter) 

Lombok can also generate getters, setters, equals and hascode methods :

```java
import lombok.EqualsAndHashCode;
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.Setter;

@Getter @Setter @EqualsAndHashCode
public class Person {
    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;
    private int age;
    private String email;
}
```

Lombok can be configured to generate chainable (returning `this`) and fluent accessors so we can write : 

```java
Person homer = new Person()
	            	.firstName("Homer")
                	.lastName("Simpson")
                	.age(39)
                	.email("hsimpson@burns-corp.com");
```

### @Builder

If instead of/in addition to the fluent and chainable accessors a `Builder` is need (useful when all the properties are `final`... _Immutability_ ) Lombok provides a `@Builder` annotation that generates a builder so we can use : 

```java
Person homer = Person.builder()
                .firstName("Homer")
                .lastName("Simpson")
                .age(39)
                .email("hsimpson@burns-corp.com")
                .build();                
```

### val/var 

I don't use these features everywhere but sometimes they can be useful. 
`val` avoids writing the type of a variable by inferring it. 
It also declares the variable as `final`

```java
import lombok.val;
//...
val homer = new Person().firstName("Homer").lastName("Simpson");
``` 

`var` works exactly like `val`, except the local variable is not declared as `final`.

## More Features

Lombok offers a lot more feature that may be useful: 

**@Data** : a shortcut for `@ToString`, `@EqualsAndHashCode`, `@Getter` and `@Setter`

**Constructors** : `@NoArgsConstructor`, `@RequiredArgsConstructor` and `@AllArgsConstructor`

Lombok can be configured using a simple config file [lombok.config](https://projectlombok.org/features/configuration)
